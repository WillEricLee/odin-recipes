	<p>Miso salmon is a classic Japanese dish and great way to prepare salmon under any context.</p>
	<p>Quick, easy, and simple, miso salmon with rice is a great weeknight meal for when you want something good, but nothing too difficult.</p>
	<p>This is one of my personal favorites and it never fails to hit. Let me show you how it's done the real way:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Salmon fillet (less than 1 inch thick perferably)</li>
		<li>White miso</li>
		<li>Shoyu (soy sauce)</li>
		<li>Brown sugar</li>
		<li>Mirin</li>
		<li>Roasted sesame oil (just a bit)</li>
		<li>Garnish:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Toasted black and white sesame seeds</li>
			<li>Chopped green onion</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<ol>
		<li>Salt and pepper the salmon</li>
		<li>In a small bowl add the miso paste, soy sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. Wisk together until smooth. Reserve 1 tablespoon of marinade.</li>
		<li>In a medium sized bowl add the salmon and the sauce. Let it marinade for 1-3 hours.</li>
		<li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a large skillet or oven safe frying pan add the salmon and discard marinade. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until fish is almost done and opaque. Brush with reserved glaze and Broil on high for 1-2 minutes until fish reaches 125-130 degrees in the center.</li>
		<li>Garnish with sesame seeds or green onions if desired.</li>
	</ol>
